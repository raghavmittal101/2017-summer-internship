* Introduction
  This document hols the time sheets for my work during the summer internship
  at VLEAD, IIIT Hyderabad

* Month of June
** Week 1 [2017-06-01 Thu] till [2017-06-04 Sun]
   + [2017-06-01 Thu] -
     - The mentors were introduced and the projects were assigned in the
       morning.
     - Project currently being worked on is the rewriting of the
       =web-app-short-course= in Haskell.
     - I read the requirements, documentation and code for the =web-app-short-course=
     - I noted ideas on how to implement it in Haskell, and the (intended)
       differences between the original implementation and the Haskell
       implementation. These will be later uploaded in a notes file.
     - I also made a note of problems we will face in the implementation, and
       discussed with my mentor about resources needed
     - Additionally, I compared two Haskell web frameworks- Servant and
       Yesod- to see which one is more appropriate for my implementation.
** Week 2 [2017-06-05 Mon] till [2017-06-11 Sun]
   + [2017-06-02 Fri]
