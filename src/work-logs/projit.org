* Introduction
  This document hols the time sheets for my work during the summer internship
  at VLEAD, IIIT Hyderabad



* Month of June
** Week 1 [2017-06-01 Thu] till [2017-06-04 Sun]
   + [2017-06-01 Thu] - Worked on setting up development environment. Discussed
     requirements for the Authentication between VLEAD Services. For rest of
     week need to work on surveying current industrial standards for this type
     of authentication. Created survey.org document and have looked through
     resources to use. JWT seems to be the best option(Have pushed analysis and
     advantages for it) for implementing the requirements but I think our
     mentors want to to integrate with Oauth, need to find out exact scope
     and requirements for this project.
