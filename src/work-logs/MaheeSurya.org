* Introduction
  This document holds the time sheets for my work during the summer internship
  at VLEAD, IIIT Hyderabad.

* Month of June
** Week 1 [2017-06-01 Thu] till [2017-06-04 Sun]
   + [2017-06-01 Thu] - Read the documentary regarding conversion of Flash
     simulations into JavaScript. Watched some Flash simulations to get a rough
     idea. Tried to understand a sample code which used JavaScript to run the
     simulation. Cloned the required repositories and installed the necessary
     tools required for the conversion. Need to understand the codes better to
     be able to write them efficiently.
